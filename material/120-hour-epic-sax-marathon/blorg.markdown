## Synopsis

In which we follow along an implementation of a blog engine.

- State.
- Using libraries.
- Organizing code.
- The principle of "simple".

## Description

This chapter is special in that there are no exercises. Instead, we will take
an existing project and study its code and development.

## Get the project

The project is available at:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/iloveponies/blorg.git
~~~

The project for this chapter contains multiple *tags* that identify different
phases of the project as it was written. The chapter text will instruct you to
check out a certain tag to see the code as it was at a specific point in time.

To begin with, check out the tag `initial` to see the first version of the
code:

~~~
git checkout initial
~~~

## The idea

So far we have programmed various Clojure exercises and at least one larger
project (poker hands). It all feels decidedly... unhipster, though. It's
hardly [webscale]! 

We want to write a blog engine, and not just any engine, but one written with
Clojure. We also want to use ready-made libraries for writing web applications
instead of inventing our own wheel (as satisfying it would be). Additionally,
we want to keep the implementation as simple as possible.

### Exploratory coding, or why we don't have tests yet

We don't really know what we're doing yet; we're mostly gluing together
existing libraries and defining a very simple model for blog posts. We decide
to not write unit tests, and instead implement a *prototype* instead. We are
prepared to throw away this code and reimplement a new version with tests.
Alternatively, we might use the prototype itself as the production version and
write tests for it after the fact.

## Initial implementation

Using the `initial` tag we can see our first implementation. First, we should
take a look at the project definition, which tells us what libraries we are
using. The project definition resides in the `project.clj` file in the project
root directory:

~~~ {.clojure}
(defproject blorg "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.4.0"]
                 [noir "1.3.0-beta7"]]
  :main blorg.core)
~~~

This definition tells Leiningen that blorg requires Clojure version 1.4.0 and the
[noir] library version 1.3.0-beta7. It also specifies that the namespace
`blorg.core` contains the main function to be called when the user runs `lein
run`.

### The first page

Our initial implementation resides in one file, `src/blorg/core.clj`. It
contains very little code, so let us study it. First, let us take a look at
the whole file to see the overall structure. You do not need to understand
what each bit does yet; we'll go through each part individually.

~~~ {.clojure}
(ns blorg.core
  (:use noir.core)
  (:require [noir.server :as server]
            [hiccup.page :as page]))

(def *posts* [{:title "foo" :content "bar"}
              {:title "quux" :content "ref ref"}])

(defpage "/" []
  (page/html5
   (for [post *posts*]
     [:section
      [:h2 (:title post)]
      [:p (:content post)]])))

(defn -main [& args]
  (println "> blorg blog blorg")
  (server/start 8080))
~~~

That is the whole file. Let us run the program to see what it does:

~~~
blorg$ lein run
Compiling blorg.core
Warning: *posts* not declared dynamic and thus is not dynamically rebindable, but its name suggests otherwise. Please either indicate ^:dynamic *posts* or change the name. (blorg/core.clj:6)
Compilation succeeded.
> blorg blog blorg
Starting server...
2012-05-24 12:50:49.775:INFO:oejs.Server:jetty-7.6.1.v20120215
Server started on port [8080].
You can view the site at http://localhost:8080
#<Server org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server@eaecb09>
2012-05-24 12:50:49.819:INFO:oejs.AbstractConnector:Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8080
~~~

The output contains one warning, which you we will fix later, and a bunch of
interesting lines about the HTTP server launching. The line `You can view the
site at http://localhost:8080` sounds promising. Open that URL in the browser
and you should see the first version of our blog:

<a href="img/blorg-initial.png">

![First version of the blog.](img/blorg-initial.png)

</a>

### The implementation of the first page

Now that we know what the code does, we can go through each part individually.

First, we start with a regular namespace declaration, which contains our `use`
and `require` declarations:

~~~ {.clojure}
(ns blorg.core
  (:use noir.core)
  (:require [noir.server :as server]
            [hiccup.page :as page]))
~~~

We use `noir.core`, which imports the function names defined in that namespace
into our own namespace. This means we can refer to functions in `noir.core`
with just their names, like we will use `defpage`.

`require` loads just the namespace and does not import the functions. We can
refer to names defined in the namespace with the syntax `namespace/name`.
`(require 'noir.server)` would let us call `noir.server/start-server`. As a
convenience shortcut, we give shorter names to the namespaces we require:
`noir.server` is just `server` (so we can say `server/start-server`) and
`hiccup.page` is just `page`.

Next, we define some blog posts to display on the page:

~~~ {.clojure}
(def *posts* [{:title "foo" :content "bar"}
              {:title "quux" :content "ref ref"}])
~~~

The `*` characters are an idiomatic way to indicate that a name is *dynamic*,
and is a mistake on my part here. We saw that Clojure actually warned about
this; we'll change the name soon.

At this point, we have decided to represent blog posts as maps with a title
and the content of the blog post. Because using maps in Clojure is so simple
this representation works well without introducing boilerplate.

Satisfied that we can now represent blog posts, we define our web page:

~~~ {.clojure}
(defpage "/" []
  (page/html5
   (for [post *posts*]
     [:section
      [:h2 (:title post)]
      [:p (:content post)]])))
~~~

We use noir's `defpage` to define a page located at the URL `/`. It contains a
HTML 5 page that lists all the blog posts in their own `<section>` tags. We
use [Hiccup][hiccup] to write HTML as Clojure vectors; the `page/html5`
function will turn our vectors into HTML strings that are returned to the
browser. For an example, the vector `[:p (:content post)]` is roughly the same
as `(str "<p>" (:content post) "</p>")`.

We use a `for` loop to turn each post into a vector. `for` is Clojure syntax
for a *list comprehension*. The simple form of `for` we use here could be
written as a `map` call as well:

~~~ {.clojure}
(for [elem elems] (...))
(map (fn [elem] (...)) elems)
~~~

However, the `for` is more readable in this context. With `map`, the `defpage`
call would look like this:

~~~ {.clojure}
(defpage "/" []
  (page/html5
    (map
      (fn [post]
        [:section
          [:h2 (:title post)]
          [:p (:content post)]])
      *posts*)))
~~~

The last function in our file is `-main`: it is the function Clojure calls
when we run the application with `lein run`.

## Adding new posts

Our first version of the blog was a good demonstration that we knew how to
wire together the libraries we use (noir, hiccup) and how to use them to
render posts to users.

Next we would like to add a feature to the blog that make it actually useful:
adding posts. We'd like the blog page to always show, at the bottom, a form
for adding a new post. The form should have two input fields: one for the
title of the post and one for the body content. The form should also have a
submit button that adds the post to the list of posts.

Check out the `state` tag:

~~~ {.clojure}
git checkout state
~~~

### Implementation requirements

We need to implement two things: the form on the blog page, and an endpoint
that the form is POSTed to by the browser.

### The form

We define the form in its own function for clarity:

~~~ {.clojure}
(defn add-form []
  [:section
   [:h2 "Add post"]
   (form-to [:post "/"]
            (label "title" "Title")
            [:br]
            (text-field "title")
            [:br]
            (label "content" "Content")
            [:br]
            (text-area "content")
            [:br]
            (submit-button "Add"))])
~~~

We've put the form in its own `<section>` tag, and we use `hiccup.form`'s
`form-to` function to define the form. The `[:br]` vectors make sure the form
elements are properly vertical.

If you think this definition is a bit ugly, you're absolutely right. We'll fix
it soon. However, we don't yet have any way of delivering style information
with CSS to the browser. This was the quickest way of adding a form, which we
need right now to test the adding of posts.

### The end-point

We declare a new page with `defpage` to handle the POST submission from the
form:

~~~ {.clojure}
(defpage [:post "/"] {:keys [title content]}
  (swap! posts #(conj % {:title title :content content}))
  (response/redirect "/"))
~~~

The first parameter to `defpage`, `[:post "/"]`, declares that this page
handels only HTTP POST requests. The second parameter, `{:keys [title
content]}` extracts the `title` and `content` fields from the POST request.

The next line adds a new post to the vector of posts. To understand it, we need
to introduce a new syntax form and a new concept.
