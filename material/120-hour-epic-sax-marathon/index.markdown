## News feed

Important annoucements follow:

- Sometimes we need to modify some exercises on the fly. When this happens,
  new tests will appear in the main repository of the chapter (the repository
  under the organization `iloveponies` in Github). If you know git enough, you
  can merge the changes to your fork. Or you can just copy the new tests to
  the test file. **You can always copy the newest test file from Github over
  the old one on your local directory.**

- The deadline for returning solutions is Friday 23:59

- This course will give you 2-4 study creadits based on how many points you
  got. Every exercise gives a one point unless a different amount is
  explicitly mentioned.
